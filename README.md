## Development
- `npm install` to install dependencies
- `npm run lint` to lint code
- `npm test` to run all tests

### Developer Setup: Pre-commit Hook for ESLint
This project uses [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to automatically lint and fix JavaScript files before every commit.

**To set up the pre-commit hook:**
1. Install pre-commit (if you don't have it):
   - With pip: `pip install pre-commit`
   - Or with Homebrew: `brew install pre-commit`
2. In your project root, run:
   ```sh
   pre-commit install
   ```
3. Now, every time you commit, ESLint will automatically fix and lint your JS files.

## Testing
- Unit and integration tests are in the `tests/` directory
- Run unit tests: `npm run test:unit`
- Run integration tests: `npm run test:integration`
- **To run all tests, run both commands above separately.**

## GitHub Actions Workflows

### PR Build
- Every pull request triggers a workflow that installs dependencies, lints, and runs all tests.

### Release Workflow
- On every push to the `main` branch, a release workflow runs.
- **A version label is required for the workflow to succeed.**

#### How to Add a Version Label for a Release
1. **Open your Pull Request** on GitHub.
2. In the right sidebar, find the **Labels** section.
3. Click the gear/edit icon or the "Labels" dropdown.
4. Select one of the following labels (or create them if they don't exist):
    - `version:major`
    - `version:minor`
    - `version:patch`
5. Merge the PR as usual.

> **Note:** If you do not add one of these labels, the release workflow will fail and notify you.

#### What the Release Workflow Does
- Bumps the version in `manifest.json` and `package.json` according to the label, **only in the build artifacts** (not committed to the repository).
- Creates a zip file containing only the extension files needed for release.
- Publishes a GitHub release with the zip file attached.

## Wildcard Domains

You can use `*` as a website domain to match any site. This is useful if you want the extension to remove images from all websites, regardless of the domain.

- To use this, add a website entry with the domain set to `*`.
- Any image domains you add under this entry will be used for all sites.
- This is also how old settings are migrated: if you previously used the extension before the multi-website update, your settings will be migrated to a wildcard entry.

**Example:**

| Website Domain | Image Domains           |
|---------------|------------------------|
| *             | cdn.example.com        |
|               | images.another.com     |

This will remove images from any site that match the listed image domains.
